## Description: 
This project generates a unique html from a template based on user input for a project team. Using in class projects as a template I was able to figure out the majority of the assignment, though between feeling a little unwell this week and getting caught up on small details I had some difficulty towards the end, but I was able to push through with the help of a tutor who walked me through some of the finer details I was confused about. Particularly the interactions between the index, classes and generateHTML files and how data was moving between them.

## Usage:
type 'node index.html' in the integrated terminal

## Installation: 
For this application you will need to install node js and inquirer js 

## Testing:
my gitignore currently ignores the test cases so I wouldrun it like normal
